• Background: This study provides insights into improving the user experience for researchers concentrating on cultural heritage education via digital cultural and creative products (CACPs). 
• Purpose: This paper offers insightful references for researchers and promoters in the digital cultural heritage preservation sector by analysing and contrasting cultural heritage preservation innovations from several angles. It also highlights the importance of education about cultural heritage. 
• Methodology: Python is implemented for web data mining, data analysis, Chinese natural language processing, text clustering and semantic social network analysis. 
• Results: Findings show that official media, museums, and social media influencers form part of the promotional elements, and users display a greater curiosity in the landscapes and user-generated content of interactive products. The study also came to the conclusion that various kinds of cultural and creative products can mix their benefits to complement each other, which delivers consumers a more complete awareness of cultural heritage and hence draws users to interact and use these products.

Multidisciplinary Research and Practice in the Age of GenAI this year; 
Authors: Ai, Z., Ng, D.T.K., Chu, S.K.W. 
• Background: Deepfake has great potential as an educational tool, but it also poses some ethical and technical challenges. 
• Objective: The purpose of this paper is to conduct an initial review of peer-reviewed literature that discusses the use of deepfakes in education. The purpose of this report is to summarize applications, risks, and countermeasures associated with deepfake technology in higher education. 
• Methodology: The literature for this study was systematically retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The inclusion criteria for the literature were to consider research that explored the application of deepfakes in education and encoded them using an inductive/deductive approach. 
• Implications: This review examines the application of deepfake in various fields of education and how it can play a greater role in education by utilizing artificial intelligence technologies. This research contributes to educators' understanding of deepfakes and summarises how to avoid the risks associated with deepfakes. 

**E-book Market Dynamics in China: A Social Media Sentiment Analysis of Consumer Reactions to Amazon Kindle's Withdrawal**
• To be Published: Preparing for submission to Library and Information Science this year; 
Authors: Shi, L., Ai, Z., Xie, Z., Chiu, D., & Choi, S.
• Background: Utilising comments about e-books on Weibo over two years, this study looks at consumer responses to Amazon Kindle's exit from the Chinese market.
• Purpose: The objective is to investigate opinions on e-books and information-sharing practices, which offer ideas for the future growth of the e-book market in China.
• Methodology: Python was used to compile user comments covering both before and after Kindle's exit. Python and SPSS were used for sentiment analysis and comparison of variances. Using RapidMiner, clustering techniques investigated attitudes and similarity distributions.
• Findings: Along with customer responses about consumer rights and compensation following withdrawal, insights into consumer needs for e-books emerged.
• Suggestions: As discussed in Weibo comments on Kindle's departure, Amazon should classify consumer groups based on purchase time and provide different compensations depending on this.
